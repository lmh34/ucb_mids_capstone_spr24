"The clean_data folder contains the final form of the full compiled/engineered dataset with all features included. 
The augmented dataset contains projected data for every feature except for the primary target feature (monthly_fentanyl_deaths) through the end of 2025, 
primarily using univariate models to produce the predictions.
The second full dataset contains the original full dataset combined with the augmented dataset, with the target feature including data through the first half of 2024 
and all other features filled in through the end of 2025."
